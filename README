Harvard Tour

@ Renzo Lucioni, 2012


Harvard Tour is an iOS app which uses augmented reality to help tour Harvard's 
campus. 

When used on a iPhone, laying the phone flat (e.g., on a table) will
give the user a map view, with pins indicating points of interest around campus,
as well as the user's current location. Touching pin will bring it label, and
touching the label will bring up a dialogue box with more detailed information
about the landmark. 

Raising the phone vertically will switch the app into augemented reality (AR)
mode. Using the iPhone's camera, the app places markers (analogous to the pins
seen in the map view) over live camera input. As a user turns to face a marker,
the marker is highlighted in red, and the user's distance to the marker is
indicated. Laying the phone flat again will seamlessly switch the app back into
the map view.

This app was developed as a final project for CS 50 at Harvard - development is
ongoing.
