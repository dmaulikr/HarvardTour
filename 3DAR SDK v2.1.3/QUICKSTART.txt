3DAR Quick Start Instructions:

1)  Unzip the SDK zip file.
2)  Copy the "3DAR" folder directly into your Xcode project.
3)  Go to http://3dar.us/docs/ to see which frameworks and build settings to add.
4)  If you want to use the iOS simulator, link with the lib3DAR fat binary.
5)  Import SM3DAR.h and change MKMapView to SM3DARMapView.
6)  To load points at initialization time, implement sm3darLoadPoints: in the map delegate class.
7)  Add points of interest by adding map annotations.
8)  Call startCamera or addBackground on the map view after 3DAR initializes and after the view appears.
9)  Change marker icons by changing the files named 3dar_marker_icon1.png and 3dar_marker_icon1_focused.png.
10) In 3dar.plist use 3darMapMode="auto", or change to "manual" and call showMap, hideMap or toggleMap.
